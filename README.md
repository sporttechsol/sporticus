# Sporticus
## You'll never train alone
People love do sport outdoor on a public sport grounds. We can make it even better.

What was before Sporticus?
- People were doing fitness/workout outdoors alone -- boring
- People were limited in exercises they know -- not effective, better with a coach who knows more
- Semi-pro coaches would like to make money out of their knowledge, but can't.
- Pro coaches were limited in their audience


How does it look like with Sporticus?
- Semi-pro coaches gather people together outdoors for training and make money. Part time job.
- Pro-coaches expand their audience, build their brand
- People socialise on a group trainings
- People can enjoy the diversity and effectiveness of exercises a coach provides.
